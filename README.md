## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the analyst team at Beatbox, a digital music store business that sells digital audio files of music recordings over the Internet. Customers gain ownership of a license to use the files, in contrast to a music streaming service, where they listen to recordings without gaining ownership. Beatbox is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global music store market. Jason Furtado, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Beatbox, believes that analyzing  data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
