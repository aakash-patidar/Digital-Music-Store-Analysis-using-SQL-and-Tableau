## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the analyst team at Beatbox, a digital music store business that sells digital audio files of music recordings over the Internet.

Beatbox is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global music store market. Jason Furtado, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Beatbox, believes that analyzing music playlist data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.
